        <h2>The Regular</h2>
        <p>I used to work at a McDonald’s next to my neighborhood to supplement my husband’s income. Student loans, credit cards, and child-rearing all took their financial toll on us, and it soon became inevitable that I would have to get a job to help out, but that’s another story altogether. The reason I’m telling you this is because of one particular customer we had during my brief stint working there, a regular. This customer is the reason why I never want to work at a McDonald’s ever again.</p>
        <p>His name was Ryan. A mid-thirties, well-to-do bachelor that worked in accounting or something for a big corporation. He would always come in towards evening on my Friday shift, and he would always order the same thing – one Big Mac and one Happy Meal to-go. Well-dressed, well-groomed, but always a little tired, he would make idle conversation as he waited for his food.</p>
        <p>One time, I asked him why he always ordered a Happy Meal with his Big Mac.</p>
        <p>“Oh, it’s because I have a special little girl waiting at home for me,” he said, a weary smile on his face. “She’s the reason why I come here every Friday night after work. It’s like an early celebration of us spending the whole weekend together.”</p>
        <p>I smiled as I took his order, telling him about my own son at home and how I wished he would never grow up so he could always be my sweet little boy.</p>
        <p>His face broke into a wide grin, “I hope my little girl never grows up either. I wish she could stay sweet and young forever.”</p>
        <p>That was several weeks ago. Ryan stopped showing up two weeks before I quit my job. I didn’t think much of it, and was soon caught up in the frantic swing of things again. It wasn’t until my husband came home late from work one night, visibly shaken and disturbed, that I realized two completely different people from completely different parts of my life would intersect in the most unexpected and horrible way.</p>
        <p>As I said, my husband came home late, quietly unlocking the door and heading to the kitchen. I put my book down and went downstairs to meet him, making sure not to wake up my sleeping six-year-old as I passed by his room. I saw my husband looking through the refrigerator, moving things aside as he searched for this night’s leftovers. As I watched him, I saw him suddenly stiffen at the sight of my son’s Happy Meal box, which contained the few fries and nuggets he hadn’t finished from earlier that day. I approached him from behind as I saw him curl his fingers into a fist, slowly pulling away from the bright red box adorned with the iconic golden arches as he rubbed his other hand down his face.</p>
        <p>I placed a hand on his shoulder, startling him before he realized it was just me. After picking out the Tupperware full of food for him, he thanked me and warmed it up. As he ate, I could feel the distress emanating off of him. Every bite carried a weight to it, every swallow an attempt to force something back down.</p>
        <p>In bed, I asked him what was wrong, and he broke down and cried. He said he didn’t want to tell me, that it wasn’t something he should share. This only made me more curious and resolute. I told him it was alright, that I could handle it.</p>
        <p>And as much as it makes me seem selfish and like a terrible wife, I regret telling him that.</p>
        <p>I held him in my arms, and he told me about his day.</p>
        <p>He had gotten a call from dispatch about a disturbance in a neighborhood not far from our own. A concerned neighbor had heard yelling coming from the house next door and called the police to check it out. My husband and his partner arrived at the house in question. There, they knocked on the door and were promptly greeted by a man, clearly agitated and nervous. When questioned, the man tried to brush it off and get them both to leave.</p>
        <p>That’s when they heard it – a scream from deep within the house. The man suddenly pulled out a gun, and they were forced to draw their own. When they tried to tell him to put it down, the man put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger.</p>
        <p>I squeezed my husband closer, trying my best to comfort him. Telling him that what he experienced was clearly traumatizing, and his reaction was perfectly normal.</p>
        <p>That’s when his voice changed, it took on a terrible edge as he continued.</p>
        <p>“But that wasn’t the worst thing I saw today, and frankly, I’m glad that fucker took his own life. Because when I went further into the house to investigate the source of the scream, I found her. A little girl, no older than eight, tied up in a small room cut off from the outside world. She was crying and absolutely relieved to see us, and I recognized her as one of the children that went missing a few months ago. The condition she was in was horrible, and that’s something I really would rather keep to myself.”</p>
        <p>My mouth hung open as I listened to his story, absolutely stunned. I closed my mouth as I processed his words, opening it again to ask a question but was interrupted as he continued.</p>
        <p>“But the thing that sticks in my mind about all this, is that the floor of the room she was in, was completely covered in Happy Meal boxes.”</p>

        <h2>The Puppeteer</h2>
        <p>Sarah Mitchell had always considered her husband, Agent David Mitchell, to be a man of order, intellect, and reason. His world was one of clear-cut facts, analyzed evidence, and unshakable logic. There was a comfort in that, in the way he could always separate emotion from investigation, shield them both from the chaos his work often entailed. So, when she discovered an unmarked file tucked away in his office drawer one evening—a file he had never mentioned—she was intrigued.</p>
        <p>The file's surface was worn, the manila edges frayed as though it had passed through countless hands before finding its way to her. The label, in faded black ink, read: RE-101 - The Puppeteer. It was a title that sent an involuntary shiver down her spine, though she couldn't yet explain why. Curiosity tugged at her like a child pulling on a sleeve, and Sarah, usually cautious, couldn’t resist.</p>
        <p>She opened the folder.</p>
        <p>At first glance, it looked like just another case file. Testimonies, photographs, surveillance reports—nothing she hadn’t seen David sift through countless times before. Yet something was different. A palpable heaviness filled the air as her eyes began scanning the contents.</p>
        <p>The first document was a brief report on a nameless victim, the identification redacted. What struck Sarah immediately was the way the incident was described. The victim had discovered an old photograph in a forgotten trunk in the attic of their childhood home. In the faded sepia image, a man stood with a puppet dangling from strings in his hand, but the puppet was not what had disturbed them. It was the man. His face was a smudged, indistinct blur—as though someone had intentionally obscured it from view.</p>
        <p>It was the kind of blur that didn’t make sense in an old photograph. The face wasn’t out of focus; it was deliberately hidden, as if a dark cloud of ink had seeped into the paper itself, making the figure seem both part of the image and not.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s breath caught in her throat as she continued reading. What had begun as a simple discovery quickly descended into a waking nightmare. The nameless victim had reported that the photograph seemed to change every time they looked at it. At first, it was subtle—just a shift in the light or the puppet’s angle—but soon, the puppet appeared to move on its own, its position different each time they returned to the image. Then came the hallucinations. Dark, distorted figures seen in the corners of their vision. Voices in the dead of night, whispers they couldn’t quite decipher. And the dreams—dreams of strings attached to their limbs, pulling them in unnatural, jerking movements, as though they had become a marionette in the hands of some unseen master.</p>
        <p>The report ended abruptly. No conclusion. No final notes. Just a single, cryptic sentence:</p>
        <p>Victim is no longer responsive.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s fingers trembled as she flipped the page. Her eyes found the next entry—another victim, a young woman this time. Similar circumstances. She had found a drawing of a puppet, half-torn and crumpled inside an old book she’d purchased at a flea market. Like the first victim, it began with strange occurrences. Items in her apartment shifting positions. Shadows that didn’t belong to anyone. And always, always, the puppet—its twisted wooden limbs and painted eyes staring, unblinking.</p>
        <p>The nightmares came next. The woman had described the sensation of being controlled, her body moving against her will. She awoke with bruises around her wrists and ankles—deep, purple marks that resembled the impression of tightly pulled strings.</p>
        <p>As Sarah read, her chest tightened. This was no ordinary case. It was as though the entity, whatever it was, thrived on more than just fear—it fed on control, on the act of manipulating its victims until they were no longer their own. Each case followed the same eerie pattern. First contact with an image—whether a photograph, drawing, or even a sculpture—triggered the descent. And once the victim was touched by The Puppeteer’s influence, there was no escape.</p>
        <p>Sarah felt a growing unease settle in her stomach. The room had become noticeably colder. She glanced at the window. It was closed. She hadn’t noticed before how still the house was—no hum of the refrigerator, no distant murmur of the TV, nothing but the sound of her own shallow breathing.</p>
        <p>She reached the last few pages of the file. One final report caught her attention. This victim was different. Not just a random bystander, but an investigator—a seasoned agent working for a covert agency known as The A.P.E. (The Apocalypse Prevention Enterprise). The agent’s testimony was more detailed than the others, filled with clinical observations. They had been assigned to investigate the origins of The Puppeteer case after several unexplained disappearances.</p>
        <p>The agent's notes were meticulous, charting their own mental unraveling as they dug deeper. They had obtained a photograph, much like the others, and described feeling drawn to it. As if something beyond their understanding had compelled them to stare. Soon, they too began to suffer the symptoms: hallucinations, insomnia, the feeling of being watched by something unseen. But unlike the others, they had one final observation.</p>
        <p>The entity is not bound to the image itself. It transcends it. It enters through the mind. Once you’ve seen it, once you’ve acknowledged its existence, it knows you.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s pulse raced. The words felt like a warning, meant for anyone foolish enough to read too far. Yet she couldn’t stop. Her eyes flicked down the page, hungry for more answers, for something that would explain the strange dread now gripping her. The report ended with the agent’s disappearance. No trace of them was ever found.</p>
        <p>Just as Sarah was about to close the file, something slipped from between the pages—a photograph.</p>
        <p>Her heart lurched. It was a picture of The Puppeteer. She stared at it, transfixed. The man stood in the shadows, holding the puppet in one hand, its limp wooden limbs hanging lifeless. But just like in the other reports, the man’s face was a smudged blur. She felt the room shift, as though the very walls were pulling inward, enclosing her in a tightening grip. The temperature plummeted further, her breath now visible in the air.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a sensation crawled up her spine—a cold, creeping awareness that she was no longer alone. Sarah’s eyes darted to the edges of the room, to the corners where shadows seemed to gather unnaturally thick. The photograph fell from her hands, landing face-up on the floor.</p>
        <p>In the silence, the ticking of the clock grew deafening, each second pounding in her ears. She bent down to pick up the photograph, but hesitated. Something was wrong. The puppet—it had moved.</p>
        <p>Its head was now turned, ever so slightly, looking directly at her.</p>
        <p>Sarah's breath hitched. She jerked upright, eyes wide, heart hammering in her chest.</p>
        <p>Her instinct was to flee, to leave the file, the photograph, the room—everything—but her legs refused to move. Her mind whirled. Had she seen it? Really seen it move?</p>
        <p>Then she remembered. The warning. She glanced at the file’s cover again. This time, the words in bold at the top seemed to scream at her:</p>
        <p>Do not open without official A.P.E. protective eyewear.</p>
        <p>Her stomach dropped. It was too late. She had opened it. She had seen it. And now, it had seen her.</p>
        <p>The room dimmed as the shadows lengthened, closing in, and Sarah felt the unmistakable pull of invisible strings tightening around her wrists.</p>
        <p>She wasn’t alone anymore.</p>

        <h2>A Heart in Porcelain</h2>
        <p>Emma lived a quiet life, one stitched together by the mundanity of days passing unnoticed. Yet, there were memories—whispers from a time long buried—that occasionally returned to her, like the shadows that stretched across her walls at dusk.</p>            
        <p>The scar on her shoulder, for instance. She couldn’t remember how it came to be. It had faded with time, as if it belonged to someone else—someone who had lived long before her.</p>
        <p>Then, there was the doll.</p>
        <p>It had been her constant companion in childhood. A porcelain doll with glassy eyes, delicate lace, and frayed clothes—something she had clung to through childhood’s tender years. She loved it fiercely, like a secret kept close, until one day it was no longer a part of her world. It went into a box, wrapped in memories, and into a donation bin, swallowed by the distance between who she had been and who she was becoming.</p>
        <p>But sometimes, things don’t fade. Sometimes, things don’t disappear.</p>
        <p>It started with a feeling. A presence in the corner of her eye. She’d be alone in her room, the air thick with quiet, and in the flickering light, the doll would appear—just there, in the corner of the shelf, staring at her with cold, unmoving eyes.</p>
        <p>She shook it off as an illusion, an empty mind playing tricks. But as the days went on, it became harder to ignore. The doll—her doll—was back. How? Why? She didn’t remember bringing it back, didn’t remember the moment it returned. It simply was.</p>
        <p>And the air in her apartment began to change. The corners of rooms seemed darker, as if some forgotten memory had awoken in the walls, seeping into the very fabric of the space. Emma couldn’t escape the feeling of being watched.</p>
        <p>One night, she saw the girl.</p>
        <p>She appeared in the mist, as if conjured by the fog itself. Her face pale, hair dark, eyes like shards of glass. She stood under the dim glow of a streetlamp, staring at Emma with an expression that was not quite recognition but something deeper, older.</p>
        <p>"You should be careful," the girl whispered, her voice carried by the wind. "She’s waiting for you."</p>
        <p>"Who?" Emma managed, the words catching in her throat.</p>
        <p>The girl didn’t answer. She only smiled—a sad, knowing smile—and turned, fading into the night, swallowed by the mist as if she had never been there at all.</p>
        <p>That night, Emma lay in bed, the shadows creeping along the walls. Her mind reeled, but her thoughts drifted to a memory—a dream that wasn’t quite a dream. She was small, holding the doll in her arms, running in front of an oncoming car. The sudden rush of wind. The squeal of tires. The searing pain in her shoulder as she pushed the doll out of harm’s way.</p>
        <p>The memory felt jagged, like shards of broken glass. And as she lay there, trying to breathe through the tension building in her chest, a sudden thought took root: The doll had been there. It had been with her when she needed it most.</p>
        <p>Emma’s eyes snapped open.</p>
        <p>The scar on her shoulder burned. Her breath caught.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t just a doll. She hadn’t just saved it. She had given it something more.</p>
        <p>The next day, the girl was there again, standing on the same corner, watching her with an intensity that made Emma’s skin prickle. "She’s waiting," the girl repeated softly, almost mournfully.</p>
        <p>Emma didn’t speak, but something deep inside her—something she couldn’t understand—compelled her to step forward.</p>
        <p>And then it happened. A car, out of nowhere, swerved toward her—too fast, too close. Time slowed. But before she could even think to move, something—someone—pulled her back, hard.</p>
        <p>The car roared past, mere inches from her.</p>
        <p>The girl was gone.</p>
        <p>But not before Emma saw it—the scar on her shoulder, matching her own. Deep. Raw. Real.</p>
        <p>And in that moment, the puzzle pieces fell into place. The girl, the doll, the scar. It was the doll. She was the doll.</p>
        <p>The doll that had earned life because of Emma’s sacrifice. The one Emma had saved all those years ago, when the world felt like a fragile thing, one bad turn away from breaking. The doll had come back, not to haunt her, but to protect her.</p>
        <p>The truth was a quiet thing, sinking into Emma’s bones like the slow decay of a forgotten song.</p>
        <p>That night, she dreamed again, but this time, it wasn’t a dream. It was a flood of memories, a rush of images she had long forgotten.</p>
        <p>She saw herself as a child, clutching the doll. She saw herself crossing the street, hearing the screech of tires, feeling the sharp bite of the car’s path just inches from her. But then she saw something else: the doll’s eyes. Not just glassy and empty, but alive. And in that moment, she felt the doll’s gratitude. She heard its voice in her mind, a whisper as soft as the wind.</p>
        <p>"Thank you," it said.</p>
        <p>The world around her shifted, and suddenly she was awake.</p>
        <p>The girl was gone.</p>
        <p>But the scar remained, a reminder that something had changed, something unseen had been set in motion.</p>
        <p>Emma found the old photo later, buried in a forgotten box of childhood memories. There it was—the doll, sitting quietly on a shelf, staring back at her from another time, another place. It had always been there, even when she had forgotten.</p>
        <p>And then, she remembered. The last time she had seen the doll, she had placed it in a donation box, feeling both sadness and relief. She had outgrown it. She had outgrown childhood.</p>
        <p>But the doll had not outgrown her.</p>
        <p>It had waited. It had loved her, even when she had moved on, even when she had forgotten. And now, it had saved her in return, with the scar, with the memory.</p>
        <p>Some bonds, no matter how strange, never truly break.</p>
        <p>Emma sat by the window, looking out at the empty space where the doll had once been. Her fingers brushed her shoulder, tracing the scar—her scar. A tear slipped down her cheek, unbidden.</p>
        <p>The doll had kept its promise. And in the quiet, the soft hum of the world around her, Emma finally understood: she hadn’t just saved a doll that day.</p>
        <p>The doll had saved her.</p>

        <h2>Knock</h2>
        <p>I was told to reach out here by my own intuitions and seeing through past experiences on this thread. So what the hell.</p>
        <p>To battle my own paranoia and just to get tips on general in this situation, I figured this could be a place to get some answers to my problem I’m currently having.</p>
        <p>I currently attend a university I won’t say here but just know that for the sake of this story: during the week I go to my classes Monday through Friday and I go home on the weekend to spend time with my parents. My apartment I reside in, the building of which is right next to the university, is two stories with the front doors of each apartment immediately leading to outside, with no interior section of the building to speak of.</p>
        <p>I love my apartment, it’s really small but I’m never the type of person to shy away from making a place fit my interests and hobbies to a T. I was also always a cautious person, with my key ring also holding pepper spray, and the countless horror podcasts and horror movies I watch never helping. Living in an apartment alone however, was always worth it to just live in a world of my own. I write in my spare time but I’m mostly into crocheting whenever I had free time. It’s just something I never really seem to put down, and once I started a project I couldn’t seem to stop. Other than the noisy neighbors I have, I never complain. I can heard everything they say but it’s not their fault, the walls in between the apartments are paper thin. Even when they sit on their couches that share the same wall with my own, I can hear the back of the couch hit it with a “knock” sound. Annoying but tolerable.</p>
        <p>The reason I’m even writing this to begin with started about 2 weeks ago from today, Monday. My shift was over at work and my only class for the day got moved over to Zoom. I was excited with this change in schedule because it gave me a good amount of time to get some cleaning done around my apartment and gave me some time to crochet. Once I was done cleaning, I sat down on my couch at around 7:00 pm, the sun not shining through my window in my living room any more.</p>
        <p>“Knock”.</p>  
        <p>Looked like my neighbor was done for the day too.</p>
        <p>The next day, same routine. I am never the type of college kid to go out to parties and drink, but I had no issue with that, my parents always said, “as long as I’m happy with what I’m doing.”. Well that night I got too into what I was doing, taking very little breaks to look away from the crochet projects that I was working on, leaving to straining my eyes a lot. Around the time of 8:00 pm, something felt off. I felt creeped out, like I was being watched. I didn’t look up from my crochet, I couldn’t let them know I sensed them.</p>
        <p>“Knock”.</p>
        <p>Good my neighbor was home in case anything went wrong.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, same shit, different day. But this time, I had my later 6-9 class at night. I didn’t mind it, “History of Film”, never boring to me. I got back to my apartment and felt too tired to crochet for the night so I just went straight to bed.</p>
        <p>“Knock”.</p>
        <p>I’m going to fast forward to next Monday. The knocking from my neighbors came in two’s all of the sudden./p>
        <p>“Knock knock”.</p>
        <p>I thought maybe he sat down then put his feet up, that made sense, sure. But that night when I was crocheting, it got weird. So the layout of my apartment from the point of view on my couch was that to my right, there was a corner, blocking me from seeing my bedroom door and bathroom but leaving me to still see my kitchen just enough. And to my left was just my window, front door and TV right in front of me.</p>
        <p>“Knock knock”.</p>
        <p>That feeling of being watched again. I got up and walked over to my window and pulled down the blinds to look to my right where my front door would be. Nothing. I also looked through the blinds and down at the parking lot below. My neighbor’s car, usually parked right next mine, wasn’t there.</p>
        <p>“Knock knock”</p>
        <p>I walked over to the doors peephole to make sure someone was there knocking at my door, this was at 10:00 pm so it would have been weird if someone was knocking at that hour, especially since I didn’t personally know anyone that would.</p>
        <p>“Knock knock”.</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>“Knock knock”.</p>
        <p>My heart sank. I turned around with my blood running cold. I stared towards the end of my apartment at my bedroom door, wide open. And in the frame, appearing just so, was an eye staring back at me with their knuckle hitting the lower part of the door.</p>
        <p>“Knock knock”.</p>
        <p>There was no time to think. Luckily my phone was in my pocket and my keys were on the table right next to the door. When I bolted outside of my apartment and sprinted to my car, I didn’t hear any steps behind me. The wood from outside our doors on the second floor always makes noisy sounds with the planks making hollow sounds, but this time, nothing.</p>
        <p>I called the police then my mom and dad. The drive back home was silent. I usually always drove with music on to fill the silences of a 30 minute drive but not this time. I cried to my parents when I got home. I was tired and just wanted to hear what the police had to say about the person in my apartment. We always tried to be careful with me living alone to the best of our abilities and how that would affect me emotionally and mentally, but some things like this, there’s just no justifications.</p>
        <p>The next day the news came. The cops didn’t find anything in my apartment and they questioned my neighbors, most importantly, the one right behind my couch. He just got back to his apartment from a month-long vacation that morning. I couldn’t think after the cop delivered that news to me at my parents’ house. To be honest, it was all just a blur the more and more I thought about what it meant.</p>
        <p>I missed a lot of classes after that. I felt awful for my parents having to drive me back and forth and hour all together every day. There was just so many days I never had the energy to focus to even go to any of my classes or even work.</p>
        <p>I didn’t want to go back to my apartment. My parents understood, and we all agreed the situation was exhausting on all of us. My parents paid half the rent towards my apartment, so of course they were upset about this whole thing for that fact as well, and rightfully so.</p>
        <p>Moving forward to now. My parents went out to dinner tonight with friends and left me to dog sit our two dogs for the night. The house has a better security system than my pepper spray with a locking sliding glass door and alarm that goes off whenever a door opens somewhere that’s not the garage door. It’s also spring break this whole week and at the end of break, I think I’m almost ready to go back to my apartment and we’ll obviously do a deep search when I come back. Which is why I’m here, if you guys any tips on what I should do when I get back please let me know at the bottom of this post.</p>
        <p>He’s at the screen door.</p>

        <h2>My Grandpa's Pigsty</h2>
        <p>The air had changed since I was a kid. The stench of pig shit, cow dung, and mud still clung to everything, but something was different. Nostalgia, maybe? I couldn’t place it. But for today, my job was simple—feed them, water them, and keep the fences intact. Grandpa built them to last.</p>
        <p>Speaking of, one day he just stopped existing. They said before he disappeared, he wasn't acting right. Insane, then vanished. The headlines declared it a mystery. Search parties left no stone unturned, but they found nothing. He was last seen here, near the pigsty. The authorities blamed some wanted serial killer and moved on. I never believed them. How could I? The city wanted this land for a highway or a shopping complex, but he wouldn’t budge—not even when the offers climbed to millions. They knew granddad wasn't doing quite well with cash. Fucking bastards.</p>
        <p>It’s been only a week since I arrived, a two since the last search party went home, but I’m here to honor him nonetheless. Until the animals are big and fat enough to sell, I’ll take care of the farm. Every morning, I carelessly dump a soggy bucket of wheat, meat, and the scraps from the local restaurant, the viscous mixture sloshing into the trough. The pigs scrambled, shoving each other. Some bit at tails, squealing—a chorus of snorts and grunts that turned my stomach. As I wiped my sweat, I felt grain and mud on my palms, or please God, be just mud.</p>
        <p>The fences needed checking next. A good whack was all it took, surveying the wires for holes. Nope. Still good as new. I stood up, but something felt off. A strange uneasiness crept behind me. Even the pigs stopped eating. Those gluttonous, vocal beasts—suddenly silent, not eating. Their infantile eyes fixed on something. Not at me. At something behind me.</p>
        <p>I placed a hand on my pistol, ready for anything. I turned around, and there was nothing. Only the trees and acres of land stretching into the horizon, tall blades of grass swaying in tune with the wind. As if on cue, the pigs continued eating. And when it ran out, they demanded more.</p>
        <p>Feed was in the barn, where the only cow left in the farm stayed. Blossom. An unusually affectionate cow, even for a dairy cow. As her name implies, there were two more, but they died before I got here. Their throats and calves torn apart, their torsos nothing left but bones and carcass. Local police suspected hyenas, maybe even wolves. I opened the storage cabinet, and the lock slipped off. The metal wasn’t rusted or broken—it simply fell, as if something had gnawed at it. My fingers came away sticky. A bag of feed was missing. A trail of mud led away from it, not made by slippers or even boots. It was as if something had been dragged. The area had its fair share of vagabonds. Desperate enough to steal pig feed, sure. But… that trail—those weren’t boot prints. Not even human feet.</p>
        <p>The next morning I decided to butcher a pig. Grandpa had thought me how to butcher a rabbit. But a pig? Never. He only had this pigsty a while back, he bragged about it on a letter. He was old-fashioned that way. I picked one, a fat, thick-bodied pig like a boxer. As I step into the pigsty, the other pigs went eerily silent. Staring at me. The slop I gave them left untouched.</p>
        <p>As if they know what is about to happen.</p>
        <p>I shot it. Twice. I was aiming for its forehead but it thrashed out, its cries I have never heard before. The first bullet struck its hip. Blood was everywhere. I shouldn't have done this. Fuck. The other pigs were still silent, watching their fellow swine bash its head on the concrete, on the fence and lastly on the trough. For the last bullet it went clean. In and then out. Yet as it laid dying, I could have sworn it was smiling.</p>
        <p>As the smell of iron and smoke permeates the air, the other pigs squealed, not in any way I have heard them before. It was a low guttural voice ending in a high-pitched grunt. It was rhythmic. Nothing a pig can make. Could have made, as far as I know. It sent shivers down my spine, their cries mixing against the backdrop of the leaves and their shit. Dragging the carcass was harder than I first thought. Of course, it was more than 200 pounds but still, I have lifted heavier objects than this. It was heavier, if I didn't know better I would have thought it was still alive and struggling. Then my boots slipped onto the mud, still in view of the pigsty. The pigs squealed. Not like mourning this time. As if mocking me. Laughing at me.</p>
        <p>I drove to the nearest town, the journey was just fifteen minutes long. I smelled something strange along the way. Flies aren't uncommon but there were too many. And dear God the smell! But I dismissed it eagerly, I have never lived in a rural town before.</p>
        <p>I expected to be greeted warmly by the townspeople, their community is like a fever dream, children playing, a bustling but tiny wet market. Yet I wasn't. A woman gasped, covering her nose and mouth as she passed by my truck. Then a man, old but not senile-old, wearing a uniform walked towards me. He asked me if I was drunk. I shook my head of course, although I do need a drink, I said. My quip wasn't appreciated as his stone-cold face did not change.</p>
        <p>"Any reason why you drove that thing here?" He asked, in an accent I wasn't accustomed with. I only replied with a:</p>
        <p>"Huh?"</p>
        <p>Was he asking about my truck?</p>
        <p>He then pinched his nose.</p>
        <p>"That fucking shit you got in the back."</p>
        <p>I stepped out, expecting to easily dispel the misunderstanding. I was just here for the market—</p>
        <p>I killed it no more than an hour ago! But it wasn't even a pig anymore, had it even been a pig at all? This thing... It is now just a hunk of fleshy mass riddled with maggots, dead a while ago. Days. Maybe even weeks. I nearly vomitted and I staggered back, losing my balance for a second.</p>
        <p>What the fuck did I bring here?</p>
        <p>I drove away, apologizing to the townspeople, barely hearing their murmurs and questions behind me. The officer—my grandpa’s friend, apparently—helped me bury it in the forest. He said Grandpa used to drink here on Sundays, after church. The officer was also part of the last search party. As I thanked him, I also asked what he thought happened. He hesitated, then exhaled sharply.</p>
        <p>"Your grandpa did the same thing."</p>
        <p>He whispered.</p>
        <p>"Brought a pair of pigs to town. Only, when he got here… they weren't pigs no more. Same truck. Same shock like you."</p>
        <p>As I heard the words, it crawled under my skin. My stomach churned and turned, the bile I was fighting against finally broke. I rushed over a tree and vomited into the dirt. I could see the breakfast I had this morning, coincidentally remnants of a pork sausage.</p>
        <p>I drove back to the farm uneasy, breaking into a cold sweat, the rotting stench from my truck was not helping either. My hands were slipping and it became hard to handle the steering wheel. At the distance, the farm was outwardly glowing as if it was a candle, a flickering bastion of something I could not understand or begin to do so. The pigs seemingly welcomed me back with their squeal and labored wheezing, the others trotted across the fencing.</p>
        <p>Another morning comes. I wake with a pounding headache, one that even three aspirins can’t even remove or dull. The stench of swine clings to my skin, no matter how hard I scrub with soap. It’s wrong. All of it feels wrong.</p>
        <p>While shaving, my hand slips and nicks myself. A sharp sting—blood trickles down my cheek. From the pigsty, a chorus of squeals erupts. A fox, maybe? Something must have riled them up.</p>
        <p>I pause, staring at my reflection. My beard is thick, unkempt. When did it grow this bushy? Then my eyes drift to the framed photo on the wall. A man stares back at me—strong jaw, thick eyebrows like mine. He's handsome.</p>
        <p>A warmth stirs in my chest. I know him.</p>
        <p>But I don’t know his name.</p>
        <p>I glanced at my wristwatch and suddenly it was past eleven in the morning. I find myself pouring that gray, viscous slop into the trough. It plops in, clump by clump, the nauseating stench nearly kept me from breathing.</p>
        <p>This time the pigs did not move. Their ears twitched, an occasional snort with phlegm but their legs did not move.</p>
        <p>Not at first.</p>
        <p>No scrambling, thrashing, biting tails, no ravenous behavior. Just staring. Their eyes, beady and alike ground glass locked on me. Another lets out a breathe— a long, labored wheeze.</p>
        <p>The slop sat untouched.</p>
        <p>Were they not hungry?</p>
        <p>Are they saving space for a feast?</p>
        <p>The next morning or at least I think so. Have I been here before? I cannot remember what day it is. How long has it been? The previous morning's—or I think so— slop were being eaten not by pigs but by flies and its maggots, its texture already dessicated. Yet the sight of it did not bother me anymore.</p>
        <p>Why am I here? I cannot seem to remind myself. There is a sense of longing for me here. I stepped on the mud as I went to the pigsty yet it was neither disturbed nor had my footprint. The soil does not seem to recognize me anymore. In a moment of abject clarity, I rushed to my truck, its hood and roof blowing dust as I pressed on the gas.</p>
        <p>Yet as I expect to see the quaint little town, where the kind officer was, I could only see the farm, edging closer to my view. Reality seems to be playing tricks on me. I reversed the truck, only to see the glow of the farm, the horrifying screams of the pigsty creeped closer and closer. Were their screams ever that desperate? It was a scream of something or things I have never seen or heard before— a high pitched hollering and wailing ever-increasing until my ears bled; bursting my eardrums. The truck's engine a tiny grain of sand in comparison. It pierced the sky, reverberating across my body, leaving me an atmosphere of suffocating terror. I allowed the truck to roar its engines unmovingly as I leave for the pig sty, my pistol at hand.</p>
        <p>One last time, the trough was still left untouched. The swine squeals scratched my skull from the inside. In the noise, I have finally understood. I let out a laugh, breaking my knees onto the muddy, mired with a thick sludge of excrement. I was a complete fool. I cannot recognize the man at the blurry reflection. It looked like someone I know. I did not.</p>
        <p>For they yearned not for meat or wheat or scraps anymore. The swine did not need to feed any longer if they ever did.</p>
        <p>They have already swallowed me.</p>

        <h2>The Hollow Frame</h2>
        <p>Clayton Finch did not believe in karma.</p>
        <p>He believed in luck. And timing. And knowing when to walk away.</p>
        <p>That’s exactly what he did when his father tumbled down the stairs.</p>
        <p>He didn’t push him. Not really. A step to the side, a glance away—that wasn’t murder. His father was old, frail. The fall only sped things up.</p>
        <p>When the will was read, Clayton took everything and never looked back.</p>
        <p>He found a house—a grand old thing, built from another era, with oak floors and a winding staircase. It was quiet, which he liked. No memories. No debts. Nothing to remind him of the past.</p>
        <p>Yet, something about the house felt unfinished.</p>
        <p>There was a long, empty stretch of wall in the upstairs hallway, a space where a painting had once hung. It bothered him. He couldn’t explain why, but every time he walked past, he felt like the house was waiting.</p>
        <p>Then he found the painting in the basement.</p>
        <p>It leaned against the stone wall, forgotten under layers of dust. The image was murky, little more than a smear of dark reds and browns, too faded to make out. Something about it made his stomach twist, but it was the perfect size.</p>
        <p>Without thinking, he carried it upstairs and hung it in the empty space.</p>
        <p>The moment it settled onto the wall, the house felt whole.</p>
        <p>And for a while, so did he.</p>
        <p>It started subtly.</p>
        <p>A trick of the light. A shift in the air. The painting no longer seemed so blurred. Shapes were forming. Lines becoming sharper.</p>
        <p>Clayton ignored it. It was just his imagination.</p>
        <p>But then came the exhaustion.</p>
        <p>His limbs felt heavy. His bones ached. His skin took on a sallow tone, as if something had leeched the warmth from his blood.</p>
        <p>He told himself it was stress, maybe anemia.</p>
        <p>But the painting—</p>
        <p>The painting had changed again.</p>
        <p>There were faces in the background now. Shadowy figures emerging from the gloom. Their mouths open in silent horror, eyes wide, pleading.</p>
        <p>Something in his gut told him to look away.</p>
        <p>But then he saw—</p>
        <p>He knew them.</p>
        <p>His father.</p>
        <p>The banker who had signed the inheritance papers, knowing the money wasn’t rightly his.</p>
        <p>The security guard who had turned away from a dying man outside the bank doors, locking him out in the cold.</p>
        <p>Men who had taken more than they deserved.</p>
        <p>Men like him.</p>
        <p>Clayton staggered back, his breath shallow. A sickness bloomed in his stomach, but he told himself it was a coincidence. A trick of the mind.</p>
        <p>Then he heard it.</p>
        <p>A whisper—so soft it could have been the wind.</p>
        <p>"Almost done."</p>
        <p>His body locked up. The voice had come from behind him.</p>
        <p>He turned—</p>
        <p>But the hallway was empty.</p>
        <p>Only the painting remained.</p>
        <p>And at its center, something new was forming.</p>
        <p>A face, pale and hollow-eyed.</p>
        <p>His own.</p>
        <p>The next few weeks passed in a haze.</p>
        <p>Clayton barely left the house. His skin grew thin, his breath short. Each morning, he woke feeling like he had lost something in the night. Like the painting was pulling something from him, piece by piece.</p>
        <p>He avoided looking at it. But at night, in the corner of his vision, he saw it shift.</p>
        <p>And the whispers—</p>
        <p>"Almost done."</p>
        <p>He didn’t know when it would be finished.</p>
        <p>Only that when it was—</p>
        <p>He would join them.</p>
        <p>By the end of the month, Clayton Finch was gone.</p>
        <p>The house stood empty.</p>
        <p>The painting remained.</p>
        <p>The image was clear now—at its center, a figure in red, grinning from the shadows, eyes glinting with amusement.</p>
        <p>And behind him, a new face had joined the others.</p>
        <p>Mouth open.</p>
        <p>Eyes frozen in terror.</p>
        <p>Waiting for the next one.</p>

        <h2>Update: Am I Going Crazy?</h2>
        <p>I went back. I'm still trying to process it all.</p>
        <p>The night felt heavier than ever. I didn't want to come back, but I needed to talk to Sam, and I need the money. Every step I took as I entered the lobby seemed to echo louder than usual. The jingle was playing again, but this time it didn’t annoy me—it felt like a warning, an ominous reminder that something was wrong. The absence of Sam weighed heavily on me. After talking to Mr. James, I found out she left early with no call or note explaining why. I called her phone several times on my drive home, but it went straight to voicemail every time.</p>
        <p>"I can't come to the phone right now, leave a message or call back".</p>
        <p>I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. She wouldn’t just leave without actually talking to me, right? I know we were coworkers, but I would like to think we've become friends through the months of working together. We've bonded over the fact Mr. James is a piece of work and have hung out frequently outside of the hotel.</p>
        <p>The front desk was quiet when I sat down. The pile of paperwork in front of me offered an odd comfort I tried to focus on, anything to keep my mind occupied. I didn’t know how long I could keep pretending that everything was fine, that Sam wasn't missing, that the figure I had seen on the security cameras wasn’t still lurking somewhere, waiting. I glanced at the clock: 9:15 PM. My shift had barely started, and already I felt the creeping dread begin to settle in. I checked the security cameras, half-expecting to see something in the grainy footage of empty hallways. There was, but just a kid and his mother. Relief washed over me, and I started to finish the reports part of the paperwork. A little voice whispered in my head to keep calling Sam, so I did just that. I pulled out my phone, typed in her number, and hit call.</p>
        <p>Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz.</p>
        <p>At first, I was confused. Is she in the office? No, I would have seen her when I clocked in. Did she leave her phone here? Is that why she wouldn't answer? I walked into the office to find the location of the buzzing.</p>
        <p>Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz.</p>
        <p>My confusion turned to dread quickly once I realized the noise was coming from the office coat closet. With a lump in my throat, I walk the few paces it takes to reach it. The buzzing becoming clearer with each step. I slowly opened the door and there it was. Sam's phone. Buzzing away in the pocket of her jacket, still hanging in the closet. It should have offered some type of comfort, as I was expecting something much worse, but it only added to the dreadful feeling.</p>
        <p>I closed the door and hung up, thoughts swirling through my head. She wouldn’t just leave her stuff. Did someone take her? Did she ever leave? That last one sent a chill down my spine. There was no reason for me to think that, but it was the one that stuck as I started looking around the office to see if she left anything else. A small black object under the table caught my attention.</p>
        <p>Her shoe?</p>
        <p>I picked it up, and sure enough, it was. The left shoe to the pair of black pumps she loves, lying just under a chair pushed into the circular table. After the discovery settled, I noticed a slight scuff mark on the polished wood, a singular line going from the chair to the office door. It's barely noticeable, but in the state I'm in, everything is standing out. I walked out of the office to try and see if anything else could tell me what happened. A little part of me also hoped I wouldn't find something, that my imagination was just running wild.</p>
        <p>As I entered the lobby, a woman with curly brown hair kept back by a silk scarf approaches the desk, making me jump back in surprise. She set her handbag on top of the counter and offered a warm smile.</p>
        <p>"Hello, I was wondering if we may have another ice pail? My husband is making a big fuss," she chuckled. "Room 113," she said as she pulled out 2 dollars from her purse.</p>
        <p>I return the smile and slightly wave off her money, "No need ma'am, here you go." I say as I open the cabinet under the desk, grab an extra pail, and hand it to her. Our fingertips brush against each other, I don't know how to explain the feeling of her touch other than like a feather. Almost like she brushed a ball of cotton against me. I chose to ignore it, I had too much on my mind already, and there was no need to add more to it. The lady turned and left with the pail, walking down the hallway. When she was out of sight, I started looking under the desk for more clues, I noticed that the switch to the lobby speakers was locked shut. Literally locked shut, a piece of metal with a key lock that keeps the switch suck in the 'On' position. That wasn't there last time, when did Mr. Smith put this on? It had to be recently.</p>
        <p>I stood up and saw the woman's handbag was still sitting there, so I decided to call her room and ask if she'd like me to bring it up or if she wanted to come down and get it. I turned around to the key desk behind me, which had the phone on its counter, and noticed the 2nd set of keys to room 113 was hanging on the board. I chalked it up to the couple losing it earlier in the week. Maybe Sam found them and hung them up again. I pulled out my phone and sent a quick text to the boss man, letting him know that the spare keys the room were hanging on the board and that I might have to leave the lobby to return a purse. Hitting send while I continue to call the woman's room.</p>
        <p>It rang. And rang. And rang.</p>
        <p>After a minute, I hung up and began walking to the stairs with the key and her small red leather purse in hand. I refuse to use the elevator after it broke down on me for the 5th time. Mr. James keeps reassuring me that it's been fixed and I have nothing to worry about, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Not to mention, I always felt weird when I would ride it, like the type of scared you get when someone is yelling at you. The reflex to cower in the corner and wait for it to end.</p>
        <p>I finished walking up the 3 flights and exited the stairwell, the old door making a loud creaking sound as it swung open. The age of this hotel shows itself in every nook and cranny; from the tan floral wallpaper peeling at the baseboards to the elevator buttons that get stuck if you don't push them hard enough. Even walking down the halls is a reminder, each step causing the floor to squeak and moan. The smell of permeated smoke, perfume, and recent cleaning supplies, offering an odd sense of comfort. When I reached the door, I could hear muffled sounds of a man and a woman arguing, I stood there for a moment debating on what I should do. I decided to knock. After the third one, I heard a man clear his throat and call out, "How can I help you?" In a sickly calm and charming voice.</p>
        <p>"Ma'am? I called just now but I brought up your purse, you left it on the counter in the lobby." I replied, "I also brought up your spare key".</p>
        <p>The man said something in a venomous voice that I couldn't make out.</p>
        <p>"Thank you miss, my wife can be so forgetful." He chuckled, his voice drastically different from the second before. "If you could leave it outside the door that would be appreciated, we're not decent at the moment".</p>
        <p>"There have also been noise complaints, sir" I harshly stated. There wasn't, I don't think there was even anyone else on this floor. "Calls about a man screaming. I was wondering if you knew anything about it."</p>
        <p>The sound of light menacing stomps causes me to flinch, something deep down urging me to run and get back to the lobby. So I did just that. My lungs burned from heaving air as I sprinted down the halls and stairs, the feeling only adding to my deep pitted urgency. When I reached the desk I heard my phone ding and pulled it out of the drawer. It was a reply from Mr. James.</p>
        <p>"Room 113 only has one set of keys and no one is staying in there?"</p>
        <p>What? I just heard them, and I'm quite sure it was room 113. The feeling in my stomach grew, sending a numbing feeling to my fingers and feet. The only thought going through my head was "Where is Sam?" The same thought that's been racing through my head this whole time actually. To add to the stress, it seems like someone turned the lobby music up to the maximum volume. I couldn't handle all of these things at once and before I even realized it I was slamming the fire extinguisher onto the lock of the music switch. It only took a few good swings before the annoying sound sputtered out, finally allowing me to think clearly. We'll as clear as I can. Looking back now, I wish I had just endured the ear torture.</p>
        <p>I had just gotten my breathing back to normal when I saw someone outside the window. Not just anyone. The same man from before, the one in the suit and fedora. His back was turned, but his presence made the air feel thick with a heaviness I couldn’t describe. The man seemed to be... Waiting for something. Someone.</p>
        <p>I jumped at the sound of the door opening, the sudden jingle of the bell startling me out of my thoughts. My heart raced. I stood quickly, eyes scanning the lobby, but there was no one there. The door had opened by itself. My skin crawled. I felt it again—the sensation that I wasn’t alone. I felt watched. I took a few tentative steps forward, peering further into the lobby. The silence was oppressive, thick as fog. My mind was spinning. Maybe it was the stress, maybe exhaustion, but something about this place felt… off. I looked out the window again and the man was gone, replaced by the emptiness of the front parking lot. I sat down on the chair cautiously, waiting for the next creepy encounter.</p>
        <p>About 2 hours after everything settled down, I finally felt calm enough to get back to my duties. I was vacuuming the lobby when I noticed something. There, at the entrance of the office, was the faint outline of someone peering around the door. My breath caught in my throat. I turned quickly, rushing back towards the hallway, nearly stumbling over my own feet. But just before I could make it to the stairway, I heard footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming toward me from behind. My heart pounded in my chest. I looked back to make sure they weren't close.</p>
        <p>And then I saw him.</p>
        <p>The man in the suit, the one from the security feed, stood at the end of the hall, his mangled face slightly obscured by the shadow of his hat. He took a step forward, the cane tapping rhythmically on the floor as he moved closer. I could feel the unease settle deeper into my bones. The weight of his gaze was palpable, even from this distance. The tension in the room was unbearable.</p>
        <p>I made it to the stairs and slammed the door shut, bolting up each flight like my life depended on it. And it did. Pushing past the ache in my legs and chest, I climbed all 3 cases. The slight jingle of the key in my pocket. I forgot to leave it at the door with that woman's purse. The realization giving me the idea to go to that room to hide. It was the only option other than a supply closet. Without a second thought, I ran to the room, unlocked it, and ran it. I was expecting a surprised or even upset couple to be in the room but what I was met with instead was much worse.</p>
        <p>There on the bed, laid Sam. Covered in gashes and blood. I stood there, like a deer in headlights, wondering if this was real or some type of psychosis. Hearing her cough out my name was enough verification for me and I ran to her. I ripped the pillowcase off the pillows and started applying pressure to the wounds.</p>
        <p>"The music," She whispered.</p>
        <p>I looked at her puzzled. Then, using part of the bedsheets, I wipe the blood off her bruised face. I asked her what happened but before she could answer we heard the distinct sound of an elevator ding, and then the sounds of a limping stomp accompanied by the forcefully taping against the creaking floors.</p>
        <p>Then it hit me. The music. This happens when the music stops, well it gets worse I suppose. I pull out my phone and the microphone icon to hum the song and look it up. I love the internet. It didn't take long for the man to be so close to the room we could hear him muttering. Finally, my phone brought up the song and I tapped on it as fast as I could, putting the volume as loud as it could go. I slid my phone towards the door in hopes that he would hear it and go away, at least long enough for us to leave. Tears slid down my eyes as I continued to help Sam, silently praying that some god would help us.</p>
        <p>The sounds of a man aggressively jiggling the door handle caused both of us to flinch and embrace each other. I let go only to try and arm myself with anything I could find. A broken wine bottle. Perfect. When the door flung open, I closed my eyes and lunged towards the man bottle first. Except...I didn't?</p>
        <p>When I opened my eyes I was sitting on the bed, still holding Sam. Not taking a second chance for granted, I grabbed my phone still playing the music, wrapped Sam enough to stop the bleeding, and managed to get her on my back. Realizing quickly I would not be able to go down the stairs carrying her, I walked towards the elevator. Sam was tightly holding the broken wine bottle as a precaution while we road down to the main floor and out of the hospital.</p>
        <p>We listened to that song the entire drive to the hospital. When we got there and the nurses asked what happened, I didn't know what to say. I just kept sputtering about finding her like that and the man and music, they ended up also treating me for shock with IVs and some tube thing around my nose.</p>
        <p>I am supposed to be getting a call from the police for a statement sometime this week, but I still haven't come up with a sane way to say everything.</p>
